    ],
    spiegazione:
      "Paragraph 27 of the report entitled 'Our Common Future' issued by the World Commission on Environment and Development states that Humanity has the ability to make development sustainable to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The concept of sustainable development does imply limits - not absolute limits but limitations imposed by the present state of technology and social organization on environmental resources and by the ability of the biosphere to absorb the effects of human activities.",

    spiegazione:
      "According to the Global Sustainable Development Report published in 2016 by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, there is generally broad agreement that people (or households) who do not have access to certain rights, goods or services are left behind. Such sets of must haves and the corresponding thresholds defining deprivation are often enshrined in national law and practice. Many of them are also inscribed in international law and standards. In practice, those left behind may be different groups in different societies.",

Targets are defined as aspirational and global, with each government setting its own national targets guided by the global level of ambition but taking into account national circumstances. Each government will also decide how these aspirational and global targets should be incorporated in national planning processes, policies and strategies. It is important to recognize the link between sustainable development and other relevant ongoing processes in the economic, social and environmental fields.",

      "The Handbook for the Preparation of the Voluntary National Review prepared by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs points out that one of the founding principles of the 2030 Agenda is the requirement for processes to be participatory and inclusive. In practice, this means ensuring that all stakeholders, including all levels and sectors of government, civil society and the private sector, members of parliament, and national human rights institutions, are involved in the review and implementation processes. The participation of stakeholders promotes sustainable decisions, by giving groups affected by those decisions the opportunity to communicate their needs and interests.",

    risposte: ["Recycled PET Polyester", "Cotton", "100% Organic Cotton"],
    spiegazione:
      "the raw material for these fibers is fossil fuels. Textile production consumes 1.35% of global oil production, more oil than Spain uses in a year, and significantly contributes to the fashion industry’s huge climate footprint. Synthetics also continue to have an impact long after production, shedding plastic microfibers into the environment when clothes are washed. In response, a growing number of brands are switching to recycled versions of synthetic fibers like polyester, often advertising these clothes as the “more sustainable” or “conscious” choice. The common recycled substitute for virgin synthetics are polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, the most common type of plastic bottles, which are produced in the billions each year.",

Laundering synthetic clothes accounts for 35% of primary microplastics released into the environment. A single laundry load of polyester clothes can discharge 700,000 microplastic fibres that can end up in the food chain.",
